# 3DCapacitiveSensor

This project uses the STM32F072RB MCU on the 32F072BDISCOVERY board and a large "3D" capacitor to measure the XYZ coordinates of a user's hand in physical space so that a user can move/click a computer mouse without touching anything. This project was inspired by [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikD_3Vemkf0) video.
